# Http-Requests-Handling-via-Golang
Making HTTP Requests in Golang

In this repository, you`ll find a brief implementation for HTTP requests in Go. 

That example was implemented with very high awareness to achieve the best performance of implementation GET/POST request.

Also, that code is implemented to be reusable and flexible with any other project, just add it as a package in your project and be careful to change the private accessibility of the functions to public access.

Furthermore, the previous usage of "ioutil.ReadAll()", which is deprecated now we can use "io.ReadAll()" directly from the OS package.
